    <h2 class="title"> OVERVIEW</h2>
       <li>My goal for this project was to improve an existing microinteraction 
        on The Ordinary’s website. By staying conscious of branding and utilizing 
        existing code samples, I created a working sample of a microinteraction that 
        improves the task flow of the original website.</li>


    <h2 class="title"> CONTEXT & CHALLENGE</h2>
        <h3 class="title2"> Background</h3>
        <li>The Ordinary is a skincare company that focuses on providing quality and 
        authentic products to their customers. They are transparent with ingredients, 
        letting their customers know exactly what they are getting, and this is shown 
        through the way they name their products. For this project, I want to design 
        a microinteraction for their website that adds visual appeal and usability 
        that aligns with their brand values.</li>

        <h3 class="title2"> Problem</h3>
        <li>The Ordinary’s current website offers microinteractions that do not 
        necessarily impart a positive user experience. Many functionalities on the 
        website feel useless almost, or doesn’t reflect the more modern appearance 
        of the rest of the site.</li>

        <h3 class="title2"> Goals</h3>
        <li>For this particular project, I wanted to challenge myself and create a 
        microinteration using only HTML and CSS. I wanted to see how far I could 
        push CSS in regards to animating the interaction and was pleasantly surprised 
        with the results. Through this process, however, I found that many of the 
        working samples used JavaScript or SCSS in order to create their microinteractions 
        and did not fit with my personal project goals. It was also important to me that 
        my microinteraction would not complicate the user’s process or create additional 
        issues when integrated. </li>

    <h2 class="title"> PROCESS & INSIGHT</h2>
        <li>My first steps in this project were thinking through exactly what I wanted to 
        change with their existing task flow. Currently, The Ordinary’s website has a 
        ‘Quick View’ modal that appears over the image of the product on hover. I felt 
        that this prohibited the user from viewing the actual product, and instead forces 
        them to take additional steps in order to view the product. Additionally, the 
        ‘Quick View’ modal just repeats information that the user would receive when 
        clicking on the actual product listing, and I wanted to add a feature that served 
        a different purpose for my microinteraction.</li>

        <li>The Ordinary’s existing website also does not use any sort of animation during 
        their microinteractions. Because of this I decided I wanted elevate the experience 
        and create an interaction that is visually pleasing to the user. However, it was 
        important to me that the animations included in the interaction do not take away 
        or stick out from the simplistic nature of the website.</li>

        <h3 class="title2"> Alpha</h3>
        <li>For the alpha project, I wanted to include a hover state. When the user hovers 
        over the image of the product, a drop shadow would be applied to the card, the 
        product name would be underlined, and the image would transition to the next photo 
        of the product.</li> </div> </div>

        <div class="img">
            <img src="images/alpha2.png" alt="Alpha 1">
            <img src="images/alpha4.png" alt="Alpha 2">
            <img src="images/alpha5.png" alt="Alpha 3">
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="content">
        <h3 class="title2"> Beta</h3>
        <li>My beta includes an ‘Add to Cart’ button on the product card. When a user hovers 
        over the button, it fills with black and the text changes to white. When the user 
        clicks on the ‘Add to Cart’ button, a modal fades, telling the user that the item was 
        added to the cart. There are two additional buttons on this modal, giving the user an 
        option to either view their cart or check out. These buttons both have hover states, 
        filling with color and text changing colors as well.</li> </div></div>

        <div class="img">
            <img src="images/beta9.png" alt="Beta 1">
            <img src="images/beta10.png" alt="Beta 2">
            <img src="images/beta11.png" alt="Beta 3">
        
        
        </div>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="content">
        <h3 class="title2"> Final</h3>
        <li>For my final, I included additional modals that are triggered by the buttons on the 
        ‘Added to Cart’ modal. When the user clicks on the ‘View Cart’ button, a cart modal fades 
        in, it includes all the necessary information the user typically finds on a cart screen 
        and the user can toggle the quantity of the product. On the ‘Added to Cart’ modal, if the 
        user clicks the ‘Checkout’ button, a modal fades in, prompting the user to sign in or 
        check out as a guest. Both of these buttons have hover states, with a color fill and text 
        color is changed, but are inactive. The user can also input information into the Email and 
        Password field on the modal.</li></div></div>

        <img src="images/cart1.png" alt="modal 2" class="widepic">

        <img src="images/check1.png" alt="modal 3" class="widepic">
        <img src="images/check2.png" alt="modal 3" class="widepic"></div>

        <div class="center">
            <div class="content">
        <h3 class="title2"> Challenges</h3>
        <li>One of my struggles in creating the design for this microinteraction was incorporating 
        the existing style of the website into it. The Ordinary’s branding consists of a black and 
        white color palette, with light gray accents. This particular style differentiated from ones 
        I am used to working with, and I had to take a minimalistic approach when using color in order 
        to stay aligned with their current branding.</li>

        <li>I also struggled with stacking issues, in order to have the image transition from one photo 
        to another, they had to be stacked on top of each other for the transition to be seamless. 
        Referencing working samples and adjusting numeric values helped me fix this issue. When working 
        with multiple modals, I also had to be very organized with my naming conventions. A lot of the 
        time when I was working on them, the buttons would open the incorrect modal and I needed to 
        reorganize my code in order to fix this. </li>

        <li>Many of the working samples I referenced for modals included JavaScript, which is something 
        I wanted to avoid. When I did find a CSS modal sample, it didn’t include transitions or work 
        properly in my code, so I did additional research so I could have my desired animations for it. </li>

    <h2 class="title"> SOLUTION</h2>
    <li>I often found myself pulling from multiple different samples in order to create the different 
    functionalities I wanted. Although HTML and CSS are languages I am familiar with, I was also 
    learning new things about them from this project. By mapping out the current interactions offered 
    by The Ordinary’s website, I pinpointed changes I wanted to add when creating my own. I also stuck 
    to their current branding to stay true to the company’s well known aesthetic, but did modify some 
    aspects of it. I chose slightly different fonts and added a bright blue as an accent color, but was 
    used extremely sparingly within my design. With every additional layer of functionality added to my 
    microinteraction, I created prototypes for in figma. Doing so allowed me to solidify my design before 
    coding, which was a very straightforward and efficient way of working through it. </li>


    <h2 class="title"> THE RESULTS</h2>
    <li>This project was successful to me because I felt that all my major goals were met. I made working 
    microinteractions using pure HTML and CSS, and all the functions I planned to include are functional. 
    When it came to any issues I had along the way, I am happy to say that I was able to troubleshoot and 
    solve them myself, and to me, that is a success.</li>
